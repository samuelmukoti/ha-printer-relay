### Notes

- Unit tests should be written for all API endpoints and critical business logic
- Integration tests should verify end-to-end printing workflows
- Mobile apps should have platform-specific UI tests
- Use Jest for JavaScript/TypeScript testing
- Use XCTest for iOS app testing
- Use JUnit for Android app testing
- Use PHPUnit for WordPress plugin testing
